<h1>An example of some of my work</h1>

<br>
<h3>Skad Games</h3>
<p>This was a CS 2340(Objects and Design) project where a team and I had to create a game suite.
    We were required to have atleast 3 games and had the option to do some extra credit opportunites.
    For our three games, we chose to implement Tic-Tac_Toe, Wordle, and Blackjack. For extra credit,
    we added a leaderboard, a user profile, and a game hint within Wordle. To complete this project, 
    we used JavaFX as our framework and hosted this project on Github. Here are some images of our final 
    product:
